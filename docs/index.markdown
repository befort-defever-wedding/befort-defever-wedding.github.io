# Basics

We are getting married in Lawrence, KS on December 30, 2023.
We built this (most basic) website to share information about the wedding in the simplest possible manner.
No life story, just what you need to know.

# Day-prior (12/29)

We will be hosting a drop-in welcome reception for all guests at Lawrence Beer Co.
(Pennsylvania St. location) on Friday evening from 5:00 pm - 6:45 pm. If you are in town,
please feel free to stop by to visit with us, our families, 
and other guests. We hope it is an
opportunity for all to meet up with friends and make dinner plans for
the evening - whether you chose to stay at Lawrence Beer Co. or explore
the other dining options that Lawrence has to offer.

# Day-of (12/30)

The ceremony will be held at 2:00 pm at Holy Name Catholic Church in Topeka, KS.
The reception will be held from 5:15 pm to 10:15 pm at the Cider Gallery in Lawrence, KS.
Even with the travel time between Topeka and Lawrence,
there will be a gap between the ceremony and the reception.
We encourage guests to take the time to visit and explore Lawrence or relax.
Lawrence has an active bar scene for those who wish to continue the
celebration after the reception.

## Transportation

For all guests, we are offering a shuttle to and from the reception venue.

4:45 pm - Pickup at the TownPlace Suites. Please be ready by the front doors
of the hotel lobby.

5:00 pm - Pickup at the SpringHill Suites. Please note that the shuttle cannot pull
into the parking lot due to the overhang. Please wait for the shuttle near the
entrance to the parking lot.

Shuttle service back to all hotels in the Lawrence area  will be available from 8 pm to 11 pm.

Lawrence also has Uber and other transportation options.
Please contact Bridgette and Ryan with any transport-related questions.

Transportation from Lawrence to Topeka for the ceremony is available upon request.
Please contact Bridgette or Ryan if you are interested. Further information will
be provided for those that indicated interest on their RSVPs or via other means.

# Lodging

We strongly encourage all to stay in the Lawrence, KS area.
There are several options, including but not limited to,
[The Historic Eldridge Hotel](https://eldridgehotel.com/),
the [TownPlace Suites by Marriott](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/foets-towneplace-suites-lawrence-downtown/overview/),
the [SpringHill Suites by Marriott](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/lwcks-springhill-suites-lawrence-downtown/overview/),

Some guests have had issues booking at the Eldridge;
if you wish to stay at the Eldridge, consider a refundable reservation at one of the other hotels as a placeholder.
All four hotels are within reasonable proximity to Mass Street & activities (The Oread is furthest away, up a hill and on KU campus).
Please contact us if you are interested in booking through a room block.

# Travel

For those traveling by airplane, we recommend flying into [Kansas City Interational Airport (MCI)](https://www.flykci.com/).
Lawrence is a 45 minute drive from the airport.
Car rental is recommended.


# Things to do

Lawrence is a fun town, assuming it's not the middle of an ice storm. Get some exercise by rock-chalk-jaywalking
your way up and around on the [University of Kansas](https://ku.edu/) campus. If you plan on being in town
a bit longer, don't forget that Kansas City is only a 45 minute drive.

# Registry

We have a registry on The Knot. [Click here](https://www.theknot.com/befort-defever-wedding/registry) to view the registry.

**Notes**:
* We are excited to see family and friends at the wedding. Getting everyone together to celebrate the occasion is more important to us than gifts. Please do not feel obligated to get us anything.
* If nothing on the registry suits your fancy, but you would still like to do something for us, please consider the cash fund to support buying a work of art from the Cider Gallery (our reception venue). In addition to being an event space, the Cider Gallery hosts a rotating collection of local artwork. We plan on purchasing a piece from the Cider Gallery for our home. This gift will be special to us and we will be sure to share photos of the artwork once we make our purchase.
