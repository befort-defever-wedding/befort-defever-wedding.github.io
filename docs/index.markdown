# Basics

We are getting married in Lawrence, KS on December 30, 2023.
We built this (most basic) website to share information about the wedding in the simplest possible manner.
No life story or pictures here, just (hopefully) what you need to know.
More information will be added as the date approaches.

# Lodging

All are invited to stay at [The Historic Eldridge Hotel](https://eldridgehotel.com/) on Mass Street in Lawrence.
The wedding party and family will be staying at this location.
Other options near downtown Lawrence include the [Townplace Suites by Marriot](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/foets-towneplace-suites-lawrence-downtown/overview/) and [The Oread](https://theoread.com/).

# Travel

For those traveling by airplane, we recommend flying into [Kansas City Interational Airport (MCI)](https://www.flykci.com/).
Lawrence is a 45 minute drive from the airport. Car rental is recommended.

# Day-of

Plans are still being finalized...more to come soon!

# Things to do

Lawrence is normally a fun town, assuming it's not the middle of an ice storm. Get some exercise by rock-chalk-jaywalking
your way up and around on the [University of Kansas](https://ku.edu/) campus. Check out
[The Mad Greek](https://www.themadgreeklawrence.com/) if you're in the mood for a bite. If you plan on being in town
a bit longer, don't forget that Kansas City is only a 45 minute drive and has much to offer.
We could suggest more, but Google is probably going to prove more helpful.
