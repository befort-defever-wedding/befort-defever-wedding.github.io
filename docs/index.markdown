# Basics

We are getting married in Lawrence, KS on December 30, 2023.
We built this (most basic) website to share information about the wedding in the simplest possible manner.
No life story, just what you need to know.
More information will be added as the date approaches.

# Lodging

We strongly encourage all to stay in the Lawrence, KS area.
There are several options, including but not limited to,
[The Historic Eldridge Hotel](https://eldridgehotel.com/),
the [Townplace Suites by Marriott](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/foets-towneplace-suites-lawrence-downtown/overview/),
the [Springhill Suites by Marriott](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/lwcks-springhill-suites-lawrence-downtown/overview/),
and [The Oread](https://theoread.com/).
Some guests have had issues booking at the Eldridge;
if you wish to stay at the Eldridge, consider a refundable reservation at one of the other hotels as a placeholder.
All three hotels are within reasonable proximity to Mass Street & activities (The Oread is furthest away, up a hill and on KU campus).
Please contact us if you are interested in booking through a room block.

# Travel

For those traveling by airplane, we recommend flying into [Kansas City Interational Airport (MCI)](https://www.flykci.com/).
Lawrence is a 45 minute drive from the airport.
Car rental is recommended.

# Day-of

The ceremony will be held at 2:00 pm at Holy Name Church in Topeka, KS
and the reception will be held at 5:00 pm the Cider Gallery in Lawrence, KS.
Even with the travel time between Topeka and Lawrence,
there will be a small gap between the ceremony and the reception.
We encourage guests to take the time to visit and explore Lawrence or relax.

# Things to do

Lawrence is a fun town, assuming it's not the middle of an ice storm. Get some exercise by rock-chalk-jaywalking
your way up and around on the [University of Kansas](https://ku.edu/) campus. If you plan on being in town
a bit longer, don't forget that Kansas City is only a 45 minute drive.

# Registry

We have a registry on The Knot. [Click here](https://www.theknot.com/befort-defever-wedding/registry) to view the registry.

**Notes**:
* We are excited to see family and friends at the wedding. Getting everyone together to celebrate the occasion is more important to us than gifts. Please do not feel obligated to get us anything.
* If nothing on the registry suits your fancy, but you would still like to do something for us, please consider the cash fund to support buying a work of art from the Cider Gallery (our reception venue). In addition to being an event space, the Cider Gallery hosts a rotating collection of local artwork. We plan on purchasing a piece from the Cider Gallery for our home. This gift will be special to us and we will be sure to share photos of the artwork once we make our purchase.
