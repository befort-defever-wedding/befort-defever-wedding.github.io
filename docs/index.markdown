# Basics

We are getting married in Lawrence, KS on December 30, 2023.
We built this (most basic) website to share information about the wedding in the simplest possible manner.
No life story, just what you need to know.
More information will be added as the date approaches.

# Lodging

We encourage all to stay in the Lawrence, KS area.
There are several options, including
[The Historic Eldridge Hotel](https://eldridgehotel.com/),
the [Townplace Suites by Marriott](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/foets-towneplace-suites-lawrence-downtown/overview/),
the [Springhill Suites by Marriott](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/lwcks-springhill-suites-lawrence-downtown/overview/),
and [The Oread](https://theoread.com/).
Some guests have had issues booking at the Eldridge;
all three hotels are within reasonable proximity (The Oread is furthest away, up a hill and on campus);
if you wish to stay at the Eldridge, consider a refundable reservation at one of the other hotels as a placeholder.
More details will be provided as they become available.

# Travel

For those traveling by airplane, we recommend flying into [Kansas City Interational Airport (MCI)](https://www.flykci.com/).
Lawrence is a 45 minute drive from the airport.
Car rental is recommended.

# Day-of

Plans are still being finalized, so the precise times may change slightly.
The ceremony will be held at approximately 1 pm at Holy Name Church in Topeka, KS
and the reception will be held at approximately 5 pm the Cider Gallery in Lawrence, KS.

# Things to do

Lawrence is normally a fun town, assuming it's not the middle of an ice storm. Get some exercise by rock-chalk-jaywalking
your way up and around on the [University of Kansas](https://ku.edu/) campus. Check out
[The Mad Greek](https://www.themadgreeklawrence.com/) if you're in the mood for a bite. If you plan on being in town
a bit longer, don't forget that Kansas City is only a 45 minute drive and has much to offer.
We could suggest more, but Google is probably going to prove more helpful.

# Registry

Under construction...check back at the end of June for more details!
